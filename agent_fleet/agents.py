"""
ADK agent definitions for the Meltdown ice cream delivery demo.

Order assignment pipeline:
- Fleet Agent: assesses driver positions, capacity, and ETAs for new orders
- Customer Agent: evaluates order priority, urgency, and hotel context
- Dispatch Agent: synthesizes both and submits a structured driver assignment

Architecture:
- Agent execution happens inline in the workflow via TemporalModel + activity_tool.
  Each LLM call is routed through an invoke_model activity (via TemporalModel),
  and each tool call is its own Temporal activity (via activity_tool wrappers).
- The resolver agent calls tool_submit_assignment to write structured output
  into ADK session state. The workflow reads it back after the runner completes.
